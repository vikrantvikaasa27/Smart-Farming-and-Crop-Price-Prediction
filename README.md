# Farm - Intelligent Farming Mobile and Web App



Farm is an intelligent farming system that harmoniously integrates IoT and AI technologies to optimize agricultural practices and enhance crop management for farmers.

## Problem Statement

Design an intelligent farming system that harmoniously integrates IoT and AI technologies. Your mission is to develop a solution that monitors soil moisture, temperature, and crop health through IoT sensors. Implement AI algorithms for predicting the optimal time for planting crops and detecting potential diseases. With a focus on resource optimization and informed decision-making, empower farmers to elevate crop yield and enhance overall crop management practices.

## Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is a mobile and web app named "Farm" that optimizes agricultural practices and enhances crop management for farmers. It employs technologies like OpenCV to monitor crops, enables users to remotely observe crop health, and detects diseases at early stages. The app integrates weather report systems, provides real-time forecasts, and waters and fertilizes based on prevailing weather conditions. It integrates with automation systems to execute tasks in the absence of the farmer, ensuring consistent farm operations and maximizing productivity.

## Intel OneDNN Integration

Our solution leverages Intel OneDNN (Deep Neural Network Library) for efficient and accurate crop disease prediction. By utilizing Intel OneDNN's capabilities, Farm ensures reliable and high-performance AI-driven insights for farmers.

For detailed API documentation and usage guidelines, please refer to the [Intel OneDNN Documentation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onednn.html).
